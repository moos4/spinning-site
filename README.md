This will be a site that will help countless of spinning instructors all over the world.
Our plan is to make a tool that helps immensly.

all of this will only be possible because spotify did an ~~awesome~~ stupid job with their API.
they don't allow us to get the bpm :(


i dont have time to make a good readme i have to get back to coding

The site: not online yet
